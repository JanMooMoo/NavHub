# News, Updates & Articles

## Overview

{{< big_text >}}
   The NavHub News isn't just about reporting on what the NavCoin Core developers are doing. It's a place where any NavCoin community member can showcase the work they are contributing to this decentralised project.

  You! The news section is a decentralised publication about all the things happening in the NavCoin community. We’ve implemented an Content Management System to the site as a way for non-developers to add their articles. There’s still a few steps that need to take place, so be sure to read this guide if you want to contribute.

  title="Step 1: Write your article on Medium" >}}
  <br>
  1. To add a new article to NavHub, you must first have a Medium account. <br />If you don't have one, <a href="https://medium.com" target= e class="a-guide">sign up here</a>.
  <br><br>
  2. Then simply write your article using the tools provided by Medium</a>.
  <br><br>
  3. You should start your article with a title, image and short introudction paragrah since this is what is pulled through to the news listings page.
  <br><br>
  4. The title should not exceed 4 or 5 words otherwise it will be too long to fit on the latest news section on the home page.
  <br><br>
  5. A good example of a well formatted title, image and introduction paragraph can be found <a href="https://medium.com/nav-coin/privacy-implementation-vote-underway-dc50ab56ba0f">here</a>.
